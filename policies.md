# Class-specific policies

Undergraduate numerical analysis, first semester, APPM 4650. University of Colorado Boulder, Fall 2020.

## Details in a nutshell
This is a flipped class. Students are responsible for watching pre-recorded videos made by the instructor.  During the scheduled class time, students must attend the live zoom session for at least 10 minutes (for at least 90% of the lectures); class time will be used to go over homework answers, run live demos, have students work on small projects/demos, and answer questions.  Two TAs will be on zoom to help assist as well.

## Instructor and contact Information

- The instructor is Stephen Becker, Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics
- Contact him at <stephen.becker@colorado.edu>

## Teaching Assistant (TA)

- Daniel Ferguson is the graduate student TA. He is a PhD student in the Applied Math department.
- Andy Starr is an undergraduate TA (he will join the afternoon lectures). He is a Mech E and Applied Math major.
- Nick Elsasser is an undergraduate TA (he will join the morning lectures). He is a CS major.

## Meeting times
There are two different sections of this course, both online.  We suggest you attend the zoom session of your assigned section, but if necessary, it is OK for you to attend the zoom session for the other section.
- Morning section, 4650-001: 9:10 to 10:00 AM
- Afternoon section, 4650-002: 1:50 to 2:40 PM

## Office Hours
TBD

## Course Information
See the separate [syllabus document](syllabus.md).

## Estimated Workload
This is intended to have a normal workload, less than Calculus III (which is 4 credits) but more than an elective class

## Prereqs
MATH 3430 or APPM 2360 (these are ODE and linear algebra courses), and APPM 3310 (matrix methods).  Minimum grades of C-.

## Textbook
[Burden and Faires' textbook](https://sites.google.com/site/numericalanalysis1burden/) (9th or 10th edition) is our primary book, but homework problems will be written out explicitly, so it is not 100% necessary to purchase the book. This course has used this book in recent years, and it is used by the second semester class.

There are many other reasonable textbooks that can be used as a supplement.  For example,
- [Fundamentals of Numerical Computation, by Driscoll and Braun, SIAM](https://fncbook.github.io/fnc/frontmatter.html) from 2017. The first part of the book is free online, and they have examples in Matlab, Python and Julia (all good modern languages).
- [Numerical Analysis, 1e, L. Ridgeway Scott, $95](https://app.perusall.com/catalog/9781400838967), which integrates with Perusall
- [Scientific Computing: an Introductory survey, by Michael T. Heath](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~heath/scicomp/notes/). This has been used before (around 2018) for this class.
- [Numerical Mathematics, by Quarteroni, Sacco & Saleri, 2007](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781475773941) which is free on CU via SpringerLink. This is quite detailed and used for graduate courses sometimes
- [Numerical Anaysis, by Tim Sauer](https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Analysis-3rd-Timothy-Sauer/dp/013469645X). This is used by CSCI-3656 some semesters.
- [Numerical Methods: Design, Analysis, and Computer Implementation of Algorithms, by Anne Greenbaum and Tim P. Chartier, 2012](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691151229/numerical-methods), also integrates with Perusall. Focuses on a few topics.

Other good ideas are at the [CSCI-3656 class](https://github.com/cu-numcomp/numcomp-class/blob/master/Syllabus.md#Resources); in particlar, [Eijkhout (2017), Introduction to High-Performance Scientific Computing](http://pages.tacc.utexas.edu/~eijkhout/istc/istc.html) is much more high-performance implementation oriented.

## Syllabus
See the separate [syllabus document](syllabus.md).

## Recitations
There are no recitations

## Exams
- There will be **two midterms**, which might be *take-home* exams
- There is an **final** exam (done remotely, probably proctored via the Proctorio software -- you will need a laptop with zoom and a chrome browser; we'll do a dry-run first.)

## Projects

There are no projects

## Homeworks

There will be weekly homeworks.  You are allowed to drop 1 homework (this will be done automatically).

## Late assignment and cheating policy

In general, **late homework** assignments are not accepted; instead, you can use your one dropped homework.  Under exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness, including COVID-19, or serious family issues), homework can be turned in late.  If the reason is foreseeable (e.g., planned travel), you must contact the instructor in advance.

Examples:
- Your sister is getting married and you have to travel out-of-state.  That's great, but this is when you use the one dropped homework. This is foreseeable, and not an "emergency", so it does not count as an exceptional circumstance.
- A close family member becomes infected with COVID-19 and you have to return to your home country to take care of family.  This *does* count as an exceptional circumstance. Please email the instructor to discuss arrangements.

Similarly, **missing exams** are not made up except under the same exceptional circumstances.

If you miss the **final exam** for a legitimate reason, then it may be an option to get an "Incomplete" grade for the course and retake the final exam in a different semester. Otherwise, you need to take the final exam.

**Cheating** is not acceptable.  Take-home exams and homeworks are easy to cheat on if you really want to, but as this is an upper-division course, I am relying on the fact that students are here to learn (and paying the university to do so), and thus cheating does not make sense.  Cheating does not hurt the instructor, it hurts the student (and hurts the grades of honest classmates).

If a student is caught cheating, on the first occurrence, the penalty ranges from losing points on the item in question (like one test problem; this is for very minor infractions) to losing all points for the assignment (i.e., the entire homework or entire exam). Students may be referred to the honor council. On the second occurrence of cheating, similar penalties may apply, and additionally the student may fail the class, at the instructor's discretion.

"Minor infractions" include not following the instructions during an exam (in person or remote). For example, if the instructions on a remote test are to keep your microphone on and your hands in sight of your webcam, then failing to follow these instructions construes a minor infraction, and (even though cheating may not be proven) you are subject to losing points.

On homeworks, you are free to **collaborate** with other students, and to use resources like the internet appropriately. However, you must do your own work. There is a gray area between collaboration and cheating, and we rely on the students' and instructors discretion.  Copying code verbatim is never permissible.  You should be writing up your own work, and explaining answers in your own words.  Snippets of code are allowed to be similar (sometimes there is only one good way to do it), but longer chunks of code should never be identical.  If not expressly forbidden by the assignment, you may use the internet, but you may never post for help on online forums.  (Regarding forums, please use our Piazza website if you want a Q&A forum).

Cheating is not usually an issue in this class, and I have faith that students will continue to act appropriately.

## Grading
- 10% for participation (attend 90% of lectures, for at least 10 minutes).  
  - If you miss a class for a legitimate reason (sickness, important travel), you can be excused.  Doctor's notes are not needed to document illness (traveling to the student health center when only mildly sick can in fact be dangerous, as you spread disease to very sick people).
- 30% Homework.
  - Late homework is not accepted, but you are allowed one free "dropped" homework. Your lowest-scoring homework will be automatically dropped.
- 30% Midterms (2 midterms, each 15%)
- 30% Final exam

The overall grade may be **curved** as appropriate, but note that there is no set "quota" of A's, B's, etc., so you are not directly competing with your classmates.

## Course website

We will use [github](https://github.com/stephenbeckr/numerical-analysis-class) for public content (notes, demos, syllabus), and use CU's default LMT **Canvas** for private content like grades and homework solutions.  Canvas will also be used to organize things, like the **pre-recorded lectures**, comments made via **gradescope**, and Q&A forums via **piazza**.

## Online behavior
On zoom, please have your webcam on if at all possible
- Valid reasons for not having the camera on: to protect the privacy of your family or roommate, if you cannot have a virtual background
- Invalid reason: you don't feel like it, or you didn't wash your hair).

We have the same standards of behavior as we would in a classroom: appropriate attire, appropriate and not distracting virtual backgrounds, verbal and chat remarks should be respectful, etc.  Real-world backgrounds should be appropriate and professional (please, no drugs or alcohol behind you).

It's always important to have respectful remarks, and even more so in an online setting, since it is easier to get carried away with chat comments since you cannot see the effect on other people.

If we enable private chat on zoom, remember that the zoom host can later see even "private" chats. Inappropriate or inconsiderate remarks, even on private chats, are not allowed.


## Dropping the Course
Advice from your department advisor is recommended before dropping any course. After 11:59 PM Sept. 9, dropping a course results in a "W" on your transcript and you’ll be billed for tuition. After 11:59 PM Oct. 30, dropping the course is possible only with a petition approved by the Dean’s office.

Note that due to COVID-19, these requirements or dates may change.

# Generic policies

## CLASSROOM BEHAVIOR
Both students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person, remote or online. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy.  For more information, see the policies on [classroom behavior](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior) and the [Student Code of Conduct](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/sites/default/files/attached-files/2019-2020_student_code_of_conduct_0.pdf).

## REQUIREMENTS FOR COVID-19
As a matter of public health and safety due to the pandemic, all members of the CU Boulder community and all visitors to campus must follow university, department and building requirements, and public health orders in place to reduce the risk of spreading infectious disease. Required safety measures at CU Boulder relevant to the classroom setting include:
-	maintain 6-foot distancing when possible,
-	wear a face covering in public indoor spaces and outdoors while on campus consistent with state and county health orders,
- clean local work area,
- practice hand hygiene,
- follow public health orders, and
-	if sick and you live off campus, do not come onto campus (unless instructed by a CU Healthcare professional), or if you live on-campus, please alert [CU Boulder Medical Services](https://www.colorado.edu/healthcenter/coronavirus-updates/symptoms-and-what-do-if-you-feel-sick).

Students who fail to adhere to these requirements will be asked to leave class, and students who do not leave class when asked or who refuse to comply with these requirements will be referred to [Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/). For more information, see the policies on [COVID-19 Health and Safety](https://www.colorado.edu/policies/covid-19-health-and-safety-policy) and [classroom behavior](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior) and the [Student Code of Conduct](http://www.colorado.edu/osccr/). If you require accommodation because a disability prevents you from fulfilling these safety measures, please see the “Accommodation for Disabilities” statement on this syllabus.

Before returning to campus, all students must complete the [COVID-19 Student Health and Expectations Course](https://www.colorado.edu/protect-our-herd/how#anchor1). Before coming on to campus each day, all students are required to complete a [Daily Health Form](https://www.colorado.edu/protect-our-herd/daily-health-form).

Students who have tested positive for COVID-19, have symptoms of COVID-19, or have had close contact with someone who has tested positive for or had symptoms of COVID-19 must stay home and complete the [Health Questionnaire and Illness Reporting Form](https://www.colorado.edu/protect-our-herd/daily-health-form) remotely. In this class, if you are sick or quarantined, please contact the instructor via email; you do not need to disclose the exact nature of your illness.

[//]: # (Faculty: insert your procedure here for students to alert you about absence due to illness or quarantine. Because of FERPA student privacy laws, do not require students to state the nature of their illness when alerting you.  For markdown comments, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/20885980)

## ACCOMMODATION FOR DISABILITIES
If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed.  Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment.  Information on requesting accommodations is located on the [Disability Services website](https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/). Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or <dsinfo@colorado.edu> for further assistance.  If you have a temporary medical condition, see [Temporary Medical Conditions](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions) on the Disability Services website.

## PREFERRED STUDENT NAMES AND PRONOUNS
CU Boulder recognizes that students' legal information doesn't always align with how they identify. Students may update their preferred names and pronouns via the student portal; those preferred names and pronouns are listed on instructors' class rosters. In the absence of such updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the student's legal name.

## HONOR CODE
All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the Honor Code. Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code (<honor@colorado.edu>); 303-492-5550). Students found responsible for violating the academic integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic sanctions from the Honor Code as well as academic sanctions from the faculty member. Additional information regarding the Honor Code academic integrity policy can be found at the [Honor Code Office website](https://www.colorado.edu/osccr/honor-code).

## SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT AND/OR RELATED RETALIATION
The University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) is committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming learning, working, and living environment. CU Boulder will not tolerate acts of sexual misconduct (harassment, exploitation, and assault), intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), stalking, or protected-class discrimination or harassment by members of our community. Individuals who believe they have been subject to misconduct or retaliatory actions for reporting a concern should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at 303-492-2127 or <cureport@colorado.edu>. Information about the OIEC, university policies, [anonymous reporting](https://cuboulder.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0PnqVK4kkIJIZnf), and the campus resources can be found on the [OIEC website](http://www.colorado.edu/institutionalequity/).

Please know that faculty and instructors have a responsibility to inform OIEC when made aware of incidents of sexual misconduct, dating and domestic violence, stalking, discrimination, harassment and/or related retaliation, to ensure that individuals impacted receive information about options for reporting and support resources.

## RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS
Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance.
In this class, if you must miss the final exam due to religious reasons, talk to the instructor at the **beginning of the semester** to make special arrangements. If the homework is due on the date of a religious holiday, you are expected to turn the homework in **early**. If you have a religious holiday that lasts longer than one week, and so therefore you would not receive the homework with enough time to turn it in early, talk to the instructor at the beginning of the semester. For participation grades, talk to the instructor the **week before** the holiday.

[//]: # ( In this class, {Faculty: insert your procedures here}. )
